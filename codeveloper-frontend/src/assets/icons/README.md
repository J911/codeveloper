# Development SVG icon space

This repository contains a collection of vectors in SVG format. At the moment, it is only a simple container of these files. But the idea is to create something similar to [Theodore Vorillas](https://github.com/vorillaz)'s [devicons](http://vorillaz.github.io/devicons/#/main) project.

The big difference between this project and *devicons* is that **my icons have their natural colour**; they are **not in black an white**.

The following sprite contains all the icons of this collection:
